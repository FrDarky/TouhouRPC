# TouhouRPC
TouhouRPC is a program that creates a Discord Rich Presence status for Touhou games. 

## DLL files

- You can use the .dll file available in the *ExternalLibs* folder of this repo. Use the x86 or x64 version depending on which platform you used when compiling the program.  
- You can also use the .dll file available in the Discord Game SDK zip file provided by Discord. You will find the dlls under the *lib* folder. ([Link to their documentation here.](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide))
